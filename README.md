# hedgehog-game
It's a game, where your character is a hedgehog.
The game's main goal to reach 10000 point. If you did it, the game ends.
You have to use just the SPACE button for jumping. You have to jump over the walls and pick up apples. Hitting the wall = -1 life, 10 apple = 1 new life. You start the game with 5 lives. You can pick up question marks also, which cause a random event. It can be positive or negative, you can gain or lose lives. It's valid for the apples, too. If you lose every life, the game will restart after 5 seconds.You can exit from the game with the close button ('X' in the top right corner).
The repo containes the python file, images and sounds. 
Have fun!
